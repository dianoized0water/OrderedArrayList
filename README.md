# OrderedArrayList

##NoNullArrayList Class
- no instance variables
- constructors
	super();
	you can also create a NoNullArrayList with a designated capacity
- add(T thing) is boolean
- add(int index, T thing) is void
- set(int index, T thing) is T

##OrderedArrayList
- also no instance variables
- add and set would function differently.
	throw angry error messages if it's not ordered.
- would we need to check whether the add values are valid for the second add method?
